        Femboys in general
    </h1>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
        Femboy is a definition for a young boy or young man under 30,<br/>
        who represents feminine mannerisms and actions, often blurring the line between girl and a boy.<br/>
        Over time, a minority group of people has developed and find together that fall under this term or define themselves as this.<br/>
        In some areas and also in some areas of the internet femboys are associated with something sexual or a fetish.<br/>
        This may sometimes be the case or may only affect a part of it, but on the whole it has rather less to do with it.<br/>
        Also, femboys, crossdressers and traps do not necessarily have to be gay, bi, trans or similar.<br/>
        It is often the case, but not always so.<br/>
        They can be cis and straight but still love being feminine.<br/>

        About acceptance and the LGBTQ+ community
    </h1>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
        Our society is still very conservative in terms of diversity. Men must be masculine and women feminine.<br/>
        Over time, the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community (lesbian, gay, bi, trans, queer, +) slowly but surely increased.<br/>
        More and more people question their sexuality, gender and gender expression.<br/>
        Femboys are a result of this. It is still difficult to be feminine as a man.<br/>
        But with the development of the LGBTQ+ community it is getting better.<br/>
        There is no shame in being feminine as a man and masculine as a woman.<br/>
        It should become normality and be the everyday life for an open and diverse society in the future. <br/>
        Crossdressers, femboys, traps and others should be allowed to be as they want to be.
