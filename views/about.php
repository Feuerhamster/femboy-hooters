        Femboys want a place to be themself.<br/>
        So the concept of a restaurant by femboys sounds first laughable, but it gained a lot of attention.<br/>
        At the second thoughts, its quite an interesting idea.

        On October 1, 2019 @Comfy_Times posted "hooters but its staffed entirely by femboys" on twitter.<br/>
        This started a wave of memes, images and videos about this idea.<br/>
        Currently there is a GoFundMe campaign, a Change.org petition as well as many videos, pictures, a song and even merchandise.<br/>
        So it's time to take the concept seriously.

        It started with this small, maybe funny and stupid idea. But it turned into an important topic.<br/>
        "Femboy Hooters" can be a symbol for acceptance of marginal groups and the LGBTQ+ community.<br/>
        It could be something special. A place for diversity and a great attraction.<br/>
        It could be the chance to put visibility in the femboy community.
